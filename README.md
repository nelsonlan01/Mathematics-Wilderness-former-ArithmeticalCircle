# Arithmetical Circle


The "Arithmetical Circle" is a python tool and API function that proposed to contribute and extend code in `math` dot functions.

"Arithmetical Circle" is a pure mathematical abstract but useful concept and algorithm that is researched and implemented by Nelson, LAN. Gratefully, there was a local maths competition that inspired me this mystery.

Which contain 4 different aspects to calculate numbers in different similar but work out completely distinctive answers.

They are included with prefixes -- "Arithmetical Circle". "Arithmetical Circle add", "subtract", "multiply", "division".

For that theory and concept, we assume one example was given on top of the paper (`pdf` file), where the realm started. 

Single, and step-by-step proof to build up this logic and algorithm from ground zero; using proved statements to expand to different aspects of calculation; finally making the product ("Arithmetical Circle").=

# Arithmetical Circle Expansion Pack — Polygon and Pyramid

This is an expansion pack of the “Arithmetical Circle” API function that developed in mid-2020 and contributed to Hacktoberfest 2022. 

These contributions are originally a private calculating API for other game-related projects that maintain by me, and have educational purposes in Primary school mathematics education for P3, P5 gifted education.

“Polygon and Pyramid” expansion pack by the name itself to calculate the polygonal and polyhedral number, but it is not constrained to specify sides of the shape, but up to infinite sides of the polygon. 

However, the pyramidal number calculation is very different, hard to implement solid, dictatable formulas so.

The .pdf file also attached some drawn figures to demonstrate the first 4 polygonal and first 3 polyhedral numbers.
